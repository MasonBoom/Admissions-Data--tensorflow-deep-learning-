# Admissions-Data--tensorflow-deep-learning

This project is hosted on Codecademy's course "Build Deep Learning Models with Tensorflow" Skill path.

For this project, I created a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

By analyzing the parameters in the graduate admissions dataset, I used TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted to gain insight into the graduate admissions world and improve test prep strategy.

Here are the results collected from the deep learning model after setting the learning rate at 0.005
